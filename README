This simple extension for RT 3.x (Tested on 3.4 and newer) adds a dropdown
of a user's queues into RT's menubar. Using a tiny bit of javascript,
selecting one of these queues will automatically jump to a search showing
new, open and stalled tickets in that queue.

To install:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make install

then add 'RT::Extension::MenubarSearches' to @Plugins in RT_SiteConfig.pm
